Gitflow Workflow is a Git workflow that helps with continuous software development and implementing [[DevOps]] practices.  It was first published and made popular by [[Vincent Driessen at nvie|http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/]].  The Gitflow Workflow defines a strict branching model designed around the project release.  This provides a robust framework for managing larger projects.

Gitflow is ideally suited for projects that have a scheduled release cycle and for the [[DevOps best practice|https://www.atlassian.com/devops/what-is-devops/devops-best-practices]] of [[continuous delivery|https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery]].  The workflow doesn't add any new concepts or commands beyond what's required for the [[Feature Branch Workflow|http://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow]].  Instead, it assigns very specific roles to different branches and defines how and when they should interact. In addition to feature branches, it uses individual branches for preparing, maintaining, and recording releases.  Of course, you also get to leverage all the benefits of the Feature Branch Workflow: [[pull requests|Pull Request]], [[isolated experiments]], and more efficient collaboration.
