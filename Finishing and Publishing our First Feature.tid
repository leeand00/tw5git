!3. Finishing and Publishing our First Feature

!!Using Source Tree

#Click `Git Flow -> Finish Feature (from the dropdown)`
#A dialog box appears:
##In the `Finish feature:` drop down select 
###(in our example `user_input`)
##We get a nice preview of what it's going to do.
##*It's different than just a merge because it will use `git merge --no-ff feature/<feature-name>` internally, which adds an extra commit to keep the branch history separate for historical purposes.
##He selected `Delete Branch`, which would delete the local copy of the branch (not the remote one)

>''Note:'' In the `develop` branch, this would be alot easier to [[perform a revert|git revert example and diagram explanation]] since it's only one commit.

And then you can go and start a new feature.

---

!!Using gitflow in bash

```
$ git flow feature finish user_input
```

*Where `user_input` is the name of the feature to close.
**`git branch` will let you know what feature you were developing.

>''Note:'' Internally, git-flow used `git merge --no-ff feature/<feature-name>` to make sure you donâ€™t lose any historical information about your feature branch before it is removed.

Committed and then we were back on the initial branch `develop`
